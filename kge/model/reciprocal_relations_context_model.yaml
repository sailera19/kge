  # Neighborhood size.
  # During training, random permutation of the full neighborhood.
  # Otherwise, first neighborhood size of full neighborhood
  # if neighborhood is less than neighborhood size, left empty and masked.
  neighborhood_size: 12
  # Fraction of neighborhood that is randomly dropped (masked)
  # fraction on batch level, not on per entry level
  drop_neighborhood_fraction: 0.3
  # fraction of entities that will be masked
  fraction_masked: 0.
  # fraction of not masked entities that will be replaced.
  # E.g., if 0.5 are masked and fraction_recplaed is 0.5, the actual fraction of replaced is 0.25
